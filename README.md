# GitOps Integration for AKS

This repository contains YAML files used for GitOps integration with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). These files define the desired state of your Kubernetes cluster, enabling automated deployments and configuration management.

## Repository Structure
- **deployment.yaml**: Contains deployment configurations for AKS resources.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Update the YAML files as per your requirements.
3. Use your GitOps tool (e.g., Flux, ArgoCD) to sync these configurations with your AKS cluster.

## Best Practices
- Follow Azure's best practices for Kubernetes and GitOps.
- Keep sensitive information out of YAML files. Use secrets management solutions like Azure Key Vault.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the configurations.
